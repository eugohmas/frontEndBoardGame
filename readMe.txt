ok so I ran a npm init on the folder to create my package.json file

then I ran npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

then I created a file called webpack.config.js

then I added in the code to webpack.config.js

then I created a client folder and moved my index.js into it

then I added "build": "webpack", and "build-watch": "webpack -w" into my scripts in my package.json

then I did a npm run build

then I moved my index.html into my public folder

then after all your changes, you have to run npm run build
